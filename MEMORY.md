# Project Overview
- **Project name:** Repo/image/UI all `pugzilla` (package `pugzilla-journal`). The GitHub repo was renamed from `tradezilla` → `pugzilla` on 2026-07-06; GitHub 301-redirects the old URLs. Local folder is still `.../Desktop/tradezilla` and the NAS deploy dir is still `/root/tradezilla` (folder names only, harmless). Tradovate integration keeps its own identifiers (`appId: TradezillaJournal`, `deviceId: tradezilla-nas`) — do NOT rename those, they may match an external Tradovate registration.
- **Purpose:** A local, self-hosted trading journal for NQ/ES (index futures) traders. Log trades, attach chart screenshots, and analyse performance, psychology and ICT-style setups.
- **Business objective:** Personal tool for one trader (single-user), runnable on a home NAS via Docker. Not a commercial multi-tenant product.
- **Success criteria:** Data persists reliably on disk; existing trades never break on upgrade; new analytics help the owner find their edge and discipline leaks.

# Current Status
- **Current phase:** Feature-complete v2.0.0 iteration shipped and running on the owner's NAS. Maintenance/refinement.
- **Current priorities:** Keep backwards compatibility with existing trade data; small UX fixes on request.
- **Next milestone:** None fixed. Candidate follow-ups are deprioritised (see Open Questions).
- **Key risks:** Accidental data loss on schema changes; global (non-per-user) data model if multiple logins are ever used; growing single JS bundle.

# Architecture
- **High-level:** Single Node/Express server serves both the JSON API and the built React SPA on one port (3001 in-container). No separate DB — file-based JSON datastore with atomic writes.
- **Main components:**
  - `server/index.js` — Express app: cookie parsing, auth middleware, all routes, static serving of `client/dist` + `/uploads`.
  - `server/store.js` — trades datastore (`data/trades.json`), `computeMetrics()` (derived P&L/R/holding time), `FIELDS` whitelist, backups, one-time `schema-v2` safety backup.
  - `server/auth.js` — username/password (scrypt), in-memory sessions, `data/users.json`.
  - `server/playbooks.js` — playbook datastore (`data/playbooks.json`).
  - `server/tradovate.js` + `TradovateSettings.jsx` — optional Tradovate fills sync.
  - `server/csv.js` — dependency-free CSV parse/stringify.
  - Client: `App.jsx` (tabs, theme, shortcuts, modals), `helpers.js` (all stats + option constants + `APP_VERSION`), `api.js` (fetch wrappers), plus one component per view/feature under `client/src/components/`.
- **Data flows:** Browser → `/api/*` (JSON, cookie-auth) → store modules → JSON files on disk. Screenshots: multipart upload → `server/uploads/` → referenced by filename in trade/playbook records. Metrics are computed server-side on read (`decorate`) and previewed client-side (`previewMetrics`).
- **External dependencies:** Tradovate REST API (optional, needs paid "API Access" add-on). GitHub Container Registry (image hosting). No other third-party runtime services.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker image `ghcr.io/ven0x-s/pugzilla:latest` (public). `docker-compose.ghcr.yml` maps host **9088** → container **3001**, volumes `./data/trades`→`/app/server/data` and `./data/uploads`→`/app/server/uploads`. GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`) builds + pushes `linux/amd64` on push to `main` and `v*` tags. `nas-quickstart.sh` = one-command NAS setup.

# Technology Stack
- **Languages:** JavaScript (ES modules client, CommonJS server), CSS.
- **Frameworks/libraries:** React 18 + Vite 5 (client); Express 4 + Multer 2 (server); Recharts 2 (charts). No CSS framework — hand-written `styles.css` with CSS variables + `[data-theme]`.
- **Databases:** None. Flat JSON files under `server/data/`.
- **Cloud services:** GHCR only. (Google Drive backup was requested but NOT implemented.)
- **Dev tooling:** npm workspaces-style split (`server/` + `client/` each have their own `package.json`). Root scripts: `npm run setup` (install both + build), `npm start` (node server), `npm run build`, `npm run dev:server`, `npm run dev:client`. Node 18+ required; Docker image uses `node:20-alpine`.

# Important Design Decisions
- **File-based JSON store, no database**
  - Rationale: single-user, simplicity, trivial backup (copy `data/`), zero DB ops on a NAS.
  - Alternatives: SQLite. Rejected for now to keep zero-dependency persistence and human-readable files.
  - Consequences: No real concurrency control (only atomic tmp+rename writes); full-file read/write per operation; fine at personal scale.
- **Dependency-free server utilities** (scrypt auth, manual cookie parsing, custom CSV)
  - Rationale: minimise supply-chain surface; only Express + Multer as server deps.
  - Consequences: More hand-written code; must maintain it ourselves.
- **New trade fields are optional / null-tolerant + one-time safety backup**
  - Rationale: hard requirement to never break existing trades on upgrade.
  - Consequences: No destructive migrations; `store.js` writes a `.schema-v2` marker + backup once on startup.
- **Unified naming as `pugzilla`** (repo renamed from `tradezilla` on 2026-07-06)
  - Rationale: match the UI brand everywhere. The old brand split (repo `tradezilla` vs UI `Pugzilla`) is gone.
  - Consequences: GHCR image path changed to `ghcr.io/ven0x-s/pugzilla`; the NAS had to re-point + recreate its container. Local/NAS folder names left as `tradezilla` (cosmetic).
- **Single-process app serving API + SPA on one port**
  - Rationale: one container, one port, simplest NAS deploy.

# Constraints
- **Business:** Single-user tool; no multi-tenant/billing requirements.
- **Technical:** Backwards compatibility with existing `trades.json` is mandatory. Runs on Windows (dev) and Alpine Linux (Docker). Node 18+.
- **Security:** No hardcoded secrets. Passwords scrypt-hashed, never stored/logged in plaintext. Session cookie is `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax`. `server/data/` and `server/uploads/` are gitignored (never committed). Tradovate credentials live only in `data/tradovate.json`.
- **Compliance:** None applicable (personal use).

# Coding Conventions
- **Architectural principles:** Server computes canonical metrics; client mirrors them only for live preview. One React component per view/feature. Keep persistence dependency-free.
- **Coding standards:** 2-space indent; CommonJS on server, ESM on client; small focused modules; user-facing text in English.
- **Important patterns:**
  - Adding a trade field = add to `store.js` `FIELDS`, render in `TradeForm.jsx`, extend `CSV_COLUMNS` + import mapping in `index.js`. Keep null-tolerant.
  - `ChoiceField` (in `TradeForm.jsx`) = dropdown of preset options + an "Other…" free-text fallback. Reuse it for option-with-custom fields (News, Emotions, Mental mistake, Draw on liquidity, Prop firm).
  - `groupStats(trades, keyFn)` + `computeStats` power all breakdown tables. `setupTagsOf(t)` normalises `setupTags` (array or `;`/`,` string).
  - CSS theming via variables on `:root` and `:root[data-theme="light"]`.
- **Anti-patterns to avoid:** Don't hardcode secrets. Don't rewrite all trades in a migration. Don't assume `resultDollars` exists (open trades have null metrics). Don't scope-creep the JSON store into per-user data without an explicit, backed-up migration.

# Known Issues
- **Leftover `rating` field:** removed from the UI and breakdown tables, but still present in `store.js` `FIELDS` and `CSV_COLUMNS`. Harmless; can be pruned later. (Grade replaced it.)
- **Bundle size:** single JS chunk >500 kB (Vite warns). No code-splitting yet.
- **Setup performance counts:** stats count only *closed* trades, so a trade tagged but without exit shows 0 in "Setup performance". Expected, can confuse.
- **Windows line endings:** git warns LF→CRLF on commit; cosmetic.
- **Global data model:** trades and playbooks are shared across all logged-in users (not per-user). Fine for single-user; would surprise with multiple accounts.

# Open Questions
- **Multi-workspace accounts (separate trades/dashboards/playbook + switcher):** NOT built. Owner deprioritised it. Would require scoping every store read/write + a careful backed-up migration.
- **Google Drive backup/restore:** NOT built. Owner deprioritised it. Requires the owner's own Google Cloud OAuth client (client ID/secret) — cannot be hardcoded.
- **Assumptions to validate:** `package.json` versions are still `1.0.0` while the app footer/`APP_VERSION` is `2.0.0` — footer is the source of truth for "app version"; package versions were not bumped.

# Active Backlog
- **High:** None outstanding.
- **Medium:** Prune the dead `rating` field from `store.js`/CSV; consider code-splitting to cut bundle size; bump `package.json` versions to match `APP_VERSION`.
- **Low:** Multi-workspace accounts; Google Drive OAuth backup (both explicitly deprioritised by the owner).

# Recent Major Changes
- **v2.0.0 feature wave** (commits `ab946a2`→`a917133`):
  - ICT setup multi-select tags (1–9 keyboard shortcuts, custom labels in localStorage), HTF context (daily bias, HTF PDA, draw on liquidity, narrative), PO3 phase, validated TradingView URL, prop-firm account types.
  - Dashboard: account-type toggle (all / per type / side-by-side compare with separate equity curves), sortable Setup performance, PO3 table.
  - Analysis: HTF bias with-vs-against comparison + account/firm/bias/PO3 tables.
  - Playbook module (per-setup rules, screenshots, rules-followed-vs-broken comparison; `server/playbooks.js`).
  - QoL: light/dark theme toggle (persisted), global keyboard shortcuts + help modal, mobile quick-add form, version footer.
- **Earlier:** personal login/auth; Pugzilla rebrand + red-folder news; shareable canvas trade cards; psychology tracking; Insights tab (drawdown, streaks, R-histogram, tilt/overtrading, discipline split); Grade field; Dutch→English UI.
- **Latest (`a917133`):** removed redundant Rating field; Mental mistake back to preset dropdown + custom.

# AI Guidance
- **Must understand first:** This is a single-user, file-JSON app. **Never break existing trades.** New fields must be optional and null-tolerant. Server (`store.computeMetrics`) is the source of truth for P&L/R/holding time.
- **Read these files before changing behaviour (in order):** `README.md`, `DOCKER.md`, `server/store.js` (`FIELDS` + `computeMetrics`), `server/index.js` (routes + auth middleware), `client/src/helpers.js` (stats + option constants + `APP_VERSION`), `client/src/App.jsx` (tabs, theme, shortcuts).
- **Do not change without strong reason:** the file-JSON persistence model; the auth model (scrypt + in-memory sessions); the repo/image name `pugzilla`; the null-tolerant field pattern; host port 9088 in compose.
- **Extra caution:** any edit to `store.js` `FIELDS`/`computeMetrics`, CSV import/export, or Docker/compose/CI (owner deploys straight from GHCR). Restarting the server clears in-memory sessions → everyone is logged out.
- **Test loop that works here:** `npm run build` → `preview_start` (server name `tradezilla-server`, port 3001) → register/login → create trades via `POST /api/trades` → verify tabs in the browser → delete `server/data/{users,trades,playbooks}.json` + uploads to clean up. **Server-side changes require a preview restart** (then re-login, sessions are in-memory). Data files are gitignored — safe to delete.
- **Deploy flow:** commit to `main` → GitHub Actions builds + pushes the image → on NAS run `docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml pull && up -d`. Confirm the Actions run is green before telling the owner to pull.

# Session Handover
- **Completed recently:** Full v2.0.0 feature set; then a cleanup removing the duplicate Rating field (Grade stays) and restoring Mental mistake as a dropdown-with-custom. CI green, image on GHCR.
- **Recommended next actions:** (optional) prune leftover `rating` from `store.js`/CSV; bump `package.json` versions to 2.0.0; consider bundle code-splitting.
- **Important context:** Owner communicates in Dutch; app UI is English. Owner values token efficiency and a build→test→commit→push loop per change. Google Drive + multi-workspace are intentionally out of scope for now.

# AI Change Log
- 2026-07-10 — v2.2.0: (1) CSV import auto-detects Tradovate "Performance" exports (buyPrice/sellPrice/qty/boughtTimestamp…): first fill = entry and decides long/short, contract symbol stripped to base (MNQU5→MNQ) so default point values apply, source `tradovate-csv`. (2) Partial exits: new `exits` field (`[{qty,price}]`) in FIELDS/CSV (`2@29550; 1@29600` format); `computeMetrics` uses the qty-weighted avg as effective exit (returned in metrics so decorated `exit`/`contracts` are partials-aware); TradeForm has scale-out rows and disables Exit price when partials are set; share card shows "EXIT (AVG)" + per-partial line. (3) Share card: subtle QR (qrcode-generator, first client dep added since v1) top-right linking to github.com/ven0x-s/pugzilla, toggleable. — Claude
- 2026-07-09 — v2.1.1: footer now shows build id (`__BUILD_SHA__`/`__BUILD_DATE__` injected via vite `define`; CI passes `GIT_SHA` build-arg through Dockerfile ARG). `api.js` turns network-level "Failed to fetch" into an actionable message and 401s outside /auth into a "session expired, re-login" hint (in-memory sessions reset on every container update — the likely cause of user reports). — Claude
- 2026-07-06 — Renamed the GitHub repo `tradezilla` → `pugzilla` and updated all code/doc references (GHCR image path, compose service+container name, quickstart URL, README/DOCKER titles, package names, server backup filename/log). Left Tradovate `appId`/`deviceId` untouched (external identifiers). NAS had to `down` the old `tradezilla` container, fetch the new `docker-compose.ghcr.yml`, then `pull`+`up -d` the `pugzilla` image. — Claude
- 2026-07-06 — Created MEMORY.md from full-codebase analysis at commit `a917133` (v2.0.0). — Claude
- 2026-07-06 — Added Market Journal (`server/journal.js` store + `/api/journal` CRUD/screenshots, `MarketJournalView.jsx`, "Market" tab): per-day notes (date, bias, took-trades flag, what-I-saw, why-did/didn't-trade, screenshots) for days with or without trades — separate from the trades store. Also added Share-card element toggles (+ P&L in points). — Claude
- 2026-07-06 — Added shared Account-type + Playbook filters (in `emptyFilters`/`Filters.jsx`, applied via `App.filtered` so Trades+Insights stay consistent), per-trade `playbookId` selector, `By playbook` report + Trades table Account/Playbook columns, trade Notes on the Share image (wrapped, canvas grows to avoid truncation), and a larger header/login logo. `ACCOUNT_TYPES` changed to `Eval/Funded/Demo Funded/Live`. — Claude
